<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Esports have been growing in Portugal for the past few years, and with this growth the attention to competitive esports as also increased. More and more organizations are showing interest in entering this world increasing the need of new players on a more professional level. We believe that many who are willing to take this step but do not have the visibility needed to make themselves known. With that in mind and with nothing related to this in Portugal, we decided to create the eScout platform. It is aimed at both casual and professional players, event organizers and teams interested in becoming part of the esports world.</p>
<p>Our platform allows players to share their highlights with other users in order to make them, through a rating system, relevant enough to get the attention of scouts belonging to teams looking for players. The platform also integrates a messaging system that enables communication between the various entities. Additionally, it is possible for Event Organizers to create and showcase their events that will appear next to a map for all users.</p>
<p>A market study was created to evaluate market competition. We analyzed four platforms that are already in the market, the first two related to esports (Challengermode and FaceIT) and the other two related to sports but with features that could be adapted to esports.</p>
